The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive visualization so that anyone studying the history of territorial sovereignty, imperialism, or independence can get a sense of the relative and absolute quantities of land being described as well as the methods and events behind these exchanges over time. This visualization relies on the Territorial Change (v6) dataset provided by the Correlates of War Project, an organization dedicated to the open distribution of reliable quantitative data in international relations. This dataset contains tabular info on over 800 territorial changes between 1816-2018. The data includes info about the year, month, gaining/losing entity, transfer type, area of the territory, population of the territory, whether or not the entities transferring territorial ownership are continuous, and a few other variables. This visualization hopes to provide a broad perspective on territorial change over the last 200 years as well as the ability for an interested student or researcher to dive deeper into the categories and qualities of individual events or groups of exchanges.\r\n\r\n### Paper\r\nYou can view our paper here: (TODO: add link)\r\n\r\n### Running Instructions\r\nTODO: add running instructions\r\n",

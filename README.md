To view this visualization: Go to [https://dlamaute.github.io/A-Brief-History-of-Territorial-Exchange/integrate.html](https://dlamaute.github.io/A-Brief-History-of-Territorial-Exchange/integrate.html) ***using Firefox***.  We have found that other browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc) may not work with the CSV reading security permissions.  It may take upwards of 1 minute to load.

## Project Process:

1. Brainstorming: In this phase, all of us met together and made simple pen-and-paper designs.  Our initial concepts included a timeline, a bubble chart, and the ability to click-into a country's Sankey diagram.  We also thought about different ways to implement filters, but decided that buttons would be the easiest and most intuitive.  This phase took only a few days.

2. Prototyping and Initial Designing: We realized that the first layer of this project involved two types of diagrams that we could build in parallel and then integrate.  Sarbari and Hutch tackled filtering buttons, a timeline bar chart, and a placeholder randomly-packed bubble chart while Sid worked on a map-based bubble chart.  This phase took approximately 3 weeks and we presented our progress on these parallel goals accomplishments during the in-class milestone review presentations.

3. Integration: This phase mostly involved merging the map-based map with the filtering and brushable timeline.  Sarbari and Sid worked primarily on this integration while Hutch worked on creating Sankey diagrams for each country.  The Sankey diagrams were integrated as well.  This phase took approximately 3 weeks.

4. Debugging and Polishing: Once integration was complete, we spent time organizing the code, fixing bugs, and modifying the dataset so that it integrates with the visualization better.  This phase took up the half week of the project.  All group members contributed but work focused mainly on the sections that were divided up in the integration phase (Sarbari and Sid on maps/filtering and Hutch on Sankey).

## Desired Improvements for the Future:

1. Better alignment of some of the headings and filters. Since this was a group project that had to be integrated quickly, some of these details were overlooked.

2. Figuring out how to get this to run on Chrome and other browsers besides Firefox, if possible.
